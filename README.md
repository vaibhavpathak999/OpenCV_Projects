# OpenCV_Projects

This repositary contain the cool beginner projects using OpenCV in Python 3 language.
I have made these projects under my path guiders Ms. Palak Sood Mam and Mr. Utakarsh Chaurasia Sir.
I have leaned most of this under Lockdown period due to prevalent Corona Virus among society.
This is one of the best learning experience. 
Working with friends who were always willing to help and seniors who pointed every mistake and helped me to improve upon them.
I will keep working on the learnt part and would continue to add more projects in future.
Happy Coding.
